# Rdeterminant
A program using an unconventional algorithm to compute the determinant of a square matrix.
The idea is to look at a determinant as the sum of products.
Picking from the first to last rows, combinations.R gives all combinations with replacement. combinations.replacefalse.R gives all such combinations without replacement. pol.R gives the polarity of the product in the sum.

To execute 9.3.det.R you will also need in your directory:

combinations.R
combinations.replacefalse.R
pol.R

which are all included in this repository.
